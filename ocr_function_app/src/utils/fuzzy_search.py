    Performs a fuzzy search comparison on a shipping label and a list of names.

    Args:
        shipping_label (str): The shipping label contents.
        employee_list (list[str]): List of "source of truth" employee names to compare against.
        threshold (int, optional): The fuzzy search threshold; the higher, the more strict a match has to be before returning a name. Defaults to 80.

    Returns:
        Optional[str]: Name of the employee from the employee list if a successful fuzzy search is found, or None if the threshold was not reached.
